TITLE: Real-Time Transaction Anomaly Detection Architecture

BOX: Authorization Gateway
  → INPUT: card transaction data (amount, merchant, device, location)
  → SENDS TO: Feature Generator

BOX: Feature Generator
  → Behavioral features (spend history, merchant frequency)
  → Contextual features (time-of-day, distance anomaly)
  → SENDS TO: Anomaly Model

BOX: Anomaly Detection Model
  → OUTPUT: confidence score
  → IF score > approval threshold → APPROVE
  → IF score < decline threshold → DECLINE + flag
  → ELSE → ADAPTIVE VERIFICATION

BOX: Adaptive Verification Service
  → Sends push notification / SMS
  → Receives confirmation/denial
  → Sends updated decision to Authorization Gateway

BOX: Data Store
  → Logs transactions, scores, confirmations
  → Supports retraining + drift detection

BOX: Fraud Ops Dashboard
  → Exposes model metrics, slices, drift reports
