# AI-Enhanced Lending Risk Scoring with Dynamic Borrower Profiling

**Outcome (hypothetical):** Improved approval accuracy and reduced credit losses by 15% using an ML-driven risk scoring model that incorporated dynamic borrower behavior signals, alternative data, and continuous risk monitoring.

## Problem / Context

The bank relied on a rule-based credit scoring system that produced inconsistent assessments, especially for thin-file borrowers. Underwriting teams reported:

- High manual review volume  
- Conservative thresholds reducing approval rates  
- Delinquencies rising within certain customer segments  
- Difficulty keeping risk models aligned with market conditions  

The system needed a more adaptive, data-driven approach.

## Hypothesis

A machine learning risk assessment model using credit bureau data, behavioral patterns, and repayment signals would generate more accurate predictions of loan performance.

## Success Metrics

### Primary
- 15% reduction in default rate  
- 8% higher approval rate for eligible customers  
- 25% reduction in manual review workload  

### Guardrails
- Explainability aligned with fair lending regulations  
- Stable approval parity across demographic segments  
- Scoring latency under 50 ms  

## Solution Overview

- **Users:** Risk analysts, underwriting operations, compliance, and product leadership.  
- **Scope:** Feature pipeline, model evaluation, governance, and interpretability UI.

# Case Study: Improving Credit Risk Decisions

- **Context:** High false approvals were increasing charge-offs.  
- **Problem:** Precision at the operating threshold was too low for compliance.  
- **Approach:** Feature pipeline improvements, threshold tuning, reject inference, and clearer adverse action codes.  
- **Stakeholders:** Risk, Compliance, Ops, Product.  
- **Outcome:** +7% precision at fixed recall; 18% reduction in manual reviews; more transparent adverse action explanations.  
- **Trade-offs:** Slight recall reduction offset by better charge-off performance.  
- **Next steps:** Calibration monitoring, periodic bias audits, threshold A/B testing.  

## Outcome

Credit losses decreased 15%, approvals increased 8%, and manual reviews fell 22%. The model remained stable under varied market conditions and passed fairness evaluations.
