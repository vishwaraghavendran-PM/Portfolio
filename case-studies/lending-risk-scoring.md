# AI-Enhanced Lending Risk Scoring with Dynamic Borrower Profiling

**Outcome (hypothetical):** Improved approval accuracy and reduced credit losses by 15% using an ML-driven risk scoring model that incorporated dynamic borrower behavior signals, alternative data, and ongoing risk monitoring.

## Problem / Context

The bank relied on a rule-based credit scoring system that produced inconsistent assessments, especially for thin-file borrowers. Underwriting teams reported:

* High manual review volume
* Conservative thresholds reducing approval rates
* Delinquencies increasing in specific segments
* Difficulty keeping risk models aligned with market conditions

The system needed a more adaptive, data-driven approach.

## Hypothesis

A machine learning risk assessment model using credit bureau data, behavioral patterns, and repayment signals will generate more accurate predictions of loan performance.

## Success Metrics

**Primary**

* 15% reduction in default rate
* 8% higher approval rate for eligible customers
* 25% reduction in manual review workload

**Guardrails**

* Explainability aligned with fair lending regulations
* Stable approval parity across demographic segments
* Scoring latency under 50 ms

## Impact

# Case study: Improving credit risk decisions

**Context:** High false approvals affecting charge-offs.
**Problem:** Precision at operating threshold too low for compliance.
**Approach:** Feature pipeline, threshold tuning, reject inference, and adverse action codes.
**Stakeholders:** Risk, Compliance, Ops, Product.
**Outcome:** +7% precision at fixed recall; reduced manual reviews by 18%; clearer adverse action explanations.
**Trade-offs:** Slight recall drop offset by improved charge-off rate.
**Next steps:** Calibration monitoring, periodic bias audits, threshold A/B tests.

## Outcome

Credit losses decreased 15%, approvals increased 8%, and manual reviews fell 22%. The model proved stable under varied conditions and passed fairness evaluations.
