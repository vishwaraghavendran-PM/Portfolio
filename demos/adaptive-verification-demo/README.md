# Adaptive Verification Demo (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for an interactive prototype of the adaptive verification flow.

Suggested demo approaches:
- A simple HTML/JS mock showing how a transaction triggers a confirmation prompt.
- A sequence diagram illustrating message flow between authorization service and mobile app.
- A link to a hosted prototype (Azure Static Web App or GitHub Pages sub-path).

Add assets, mock APIs, or screenshots here.
